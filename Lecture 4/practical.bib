	abstract = {Genetic studies of blood pressure (BP) to date have mainly analyzed common variants (minor allele frequency {\textgreater} 0.05). In a meta-analysis of up to {\textasciitilde}1.3 million participants, we discovered 106 new BP-associated genomic regions and 87 rare (minor allele frequency ≤ 0.01) variant BP associations (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8), of which 32 were in new BP-associated loci and 55 were independent BP-associated single-nucleotide variants within known BP-associated regions. Average effects of rare variants (44\% coding) were {\textasciitilde}8 times larger than common variant effects and indicate potential candidate causal genes at new and known loci (for example, GATA5 and PLCB3). BP-associated variants (including rare and common) were enriched in regions of active chromatin in fetal tissues, potentially linking fetal development with BP regulation in later life. Multivariable Mendelian randomization suggested possible inverse effects of elevated systolic and diastolic BP on large artery stroke. Our study demonstrates the utility of rare-variant analyses for identifying candidate genes and the results highlight potential therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Background: Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAS) are hypothesis free studies that survey the 20 21 whole genome for polymorphisms associated with a trait of interest. To increase power and to 22 estimate the direct effects of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a trait GWAS are For Peer Review 23 often conditioned on a covariate (such as body mass index (BMI) or smoking status). This adjustment 24 can introduce bias in the estimated effect of the SNP on the trait. Two-sample Mendelian 25 randomisation (MR) studies use summary statistics from GWAS estimate the causal effect of a risk 26 27 factor (or exposure) on an outcome. Covariate adjustment in GWAS can bias the effect estimates 28 obtained from MR studies using the GWAS data. 29 30
Methods: Multivariable MR (MVMR) is an extension of MR that includes multiple traits as exposures. 31 Using simulations we show that MVMR can recover unbiased estimates of the direct effect of the 32 exposure of interest by including the covariate used to adjust the GWAS within the analysis. We 33 apply this method to estimate the effect of systolic blood pressure (SBP) on type-2 diabetes (T2D) 34 35 and waist circumference on systolic blood pressure both adjusted and unadjusted for BMI. 36
Results: Our simulation results show that this method provides consistent effect estimates when 37 38 either the exposure or outcome of interest has been adjusted for a covariate. The results from the 39 applied analysis mirror these results, with equivalent results seen in the MVMR with and without 40 adjusted GWAS. 41 42
Conclusion: When GWAS results have been adjusted for a covariate, biasing MR effect estimates, 43},

	abstract = {Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) is a form of instrumental variable analysis which estimates the direct effect of multiple exposures on an outcome using genetic variants as instruments. Mendelian randomization and MVMR are frequently conducted using two-sample summary data where the association of the genetic variants with the exposures and outcome are obtained from separate samples. If the genetic variants are only weakly associated with the exposures either individually or conditionally, given the other exposures in the model, then standard inverse variance weighting will yield biased estimates for the effect of each exposure. Here, we develop a two-sample conditional F-statistic to test whether the genetic variants strongly predict each exposure conditional on the other exposures included in a MVMR model. We show formally that this test is equivalent to the individual level data conditional F-statistic, indicating that conventional rule-of-thumb critical values of F{\textgreater} 10, can be used to test for weak instruments. We then demonstrate how reliable estimates of the causal effect of each exposure on the outcome can be obtained in the presence of weak instruments and pleiotropy, by repurposing a commonly used heterogeneity Q-statistic as an estimating equation. Furthermore, the minimized value of this Q-statistic yields an exact test for heterogeneity due to pleiotropy. We illustrate our methods with an application to estimate the causal effect of blood lipid fractions on age-related macular degeneration.},
